## CRITICAL: CardShark Build System Rules

**NEVER edit `CardShark.spec` directly!** This file is generated fresh each time by `build.py`. Any manual edits to `CardShark.spec` are meaningless and will be overwritten.

### PyInstaller Configuration Changes:
- **✅ DO**: Edit the `create_spec_file()` function in `build.py`
- **❌ DON'T**: Edit `CardShark.spec` directly
- **✅ DO**: Modify hidden imports, data files, or build settings in `build.py`
- **❌ DON'T**: Attempt to "fix" issues by editing the generated spec file

### Generated Files to Never Edit:
- `CardShark.spec` - Generated by `build.py`
- `frontend/dist/*` - Generated by Vite build process
- Any files in `build/` or `dist/` directories

When dealing with PyInstaller packaging issues, always trace back to the source generation logic in `build.py`.

ASK YOURSELF - DID I PROVIDE AN OVERLY COMPLICATED SOLUTION? COULD I DO THIS LESS INTRUSIVELY AND MORE EFFICIENTLY?

## CardShark-Specific AI Development Guidelines

### Architectural Patterns
- **Component Organization**: Always structure components according to their domain (chat, settings, templates, etc.)
- **Data Flow**: Follow the established pattern of hooks → contexts → components for state management
- **API Integration**: Use the existing API service pattern for all backend interactions

### Implementation Strategy
- **Incremental Changes**: Prefer minimal, targeted changes over large refactors
- **Feature Implementation**: Start with core functionality, then add progressive enhancement
- **Decision Framework**:
  1. Is this solution consistent with existing patterns?
  2. Does it minimize state complexity?
  3. Is it performant for chat interactions?
  4. Does it handle error cases gracefully?

### CardShark-Specific Patterns
- **Chat System**: 
  - Always handle streaming responses with proper buffering
  - Maintain message history with proper ID tracking
  - Use the established context window mechanism
- **Settings System**:
  - Follow the tab-based organization pattern
  - Implement real-time validation with appropriate feedback
  - Ensure settings are properly persisted to backend
- **Template System**:
  - Maintain the separation between built-in and custom templates
  - Follow the established editing and validation patterns

### Self-Assessment Checklist
Before completing any implementation, verify:
1. Does the code handle all error states appropriately?
2. Is state management optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders?
3. Are all user inputs properly validated?
4. Does the feature gracefully degrade if backend services are unavailable?
5. Are all user interactions properly debounced where appropriate?
6. Has accessibility been maintained throughout the implementation?

## Decision-Making Framework for CardShark Development

When faced with implementation decisions, follow this structured approach:

### Feature Implementation Decision Tree
1. **State Management Decision**:
   - Is this state used by multiple components? → Use Context API
   - Is this state complex with many operations? → Use useReducer
   - Is this state local to a component? → Use useState
   - Does this state need persistence? → Use domain-specific storage services:
     - For chat data → Use ChatStorage service
     - For settings → Use settings_manager.py endpoints
     - For templates → Use template_handler.py endpoints
     - For user profiles → Use user_endpoints.py
     - For world data → Use world_state_manager.py

2. **Component Structure Decision**:
   - Is this UI pattern used in multiple places? → Create a reusable component
   - Is this component getting too large (>300 lines)? → Split into smaller components
   - Does this component have multiple responsibilities? → Split by responsibility

3. **API Integration Decision**:
   - Is this a read operation? → Use GET endpoints with proper error handling
   - Is this a write operation? → Use POST endpoints with optimistic updates
   - Is this a streaming operation? → Use streaming pattern with buffer management

### Technical Approach Prioritization
When implementing features, prioritize approaches in this order:
1. **Consistency**: Match existing patterns in the codebase
2. **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
3. **Performance**: Optimize for chat responsiveness and rendering performance
4. **Extensibility**: Design for future enhancement without overengineering

## Troubleshooting Guide for Common Issues

### Chat System Issues
- **Message not appearing in chat**: Check message ID tracking and state updates
- **Streaming message not updating**: Verify buffer management and stream handling
- **Chat history not loading**: Check ChatStorage service and error handling

### Settings System Issues
- **Settings not persisting**: Verify API call to `/api/settings` endpoint
- **Settings tabs not working**: Check component hierarchy and tab selection logic
- **API configuration not taking effect**: Verify proper API service integration

### Template System Issues
- **Template not formatting correctly**: Debug variable substitution in template strings
- **Custom templates not saving**: Check template persistence and validation logic
- **Template detection not working**: Verify detection patterns are correctly implemented

## CardShark Development Environment

### Terminal Configuration
- **Default Shell**: The development environment uses `bash.exe` as the default terminal
- **Command Generation**: All terminal commands should be generated for Bash compatibility
- **Process Management**: Use standard Unix process management commands (ps, kill, etc.) when troubleshooting
- **Path Handling**: Be aware of Windows/Unix path differences when working with file operations

> **Important**: Always generate terminal commands for Bash compatibility since `bash.exe` is the default shell in this environment.

### Port Configuration
- **Backend API**: Runs on port **9696** (http://localhost:9696)
- **Frontend Dev Server**: Runs on port **6969** (http://localhost:6969) 
- **API Base URL**: All API calls should target `http://localhost:9696/api/`
- **Development URLs**: 
  - Frontend: http://localhost:6969
  - Backend API: http://localhost:9696
  - API endpoints: http://localhost:9696/api/*

> **Critical**: Never assume default ports (8000, 3000, 5000). Always use the CardShark-specific ports above.

### Common Development Issues
- **Port Conflicts**: Check for zombie Node.js or Python processes using `ps aux | grep node` or `ps aux | grep python`
- **Service Startup**: Always use `start.py` to launch both backend and frontend services together
- **Process Cleanup**: Kill lingering processes with `kill -9 <PID>` before restarting services

## CardShark Build System Guidelines

### PyInstaller Deployment Rules
- **Database Handling**: Never bundle `cardshark.sqlite` in the EXE - it should be created/managed at runtime
- **Build Dependencies**: All PyInstaller configuration changes must be made in `build.py`, specifically in the `create_spec_file()` function
- **Hidden Imports**: Add new backend modules to the `hidden_imports` list in `build.py`
- **Data Files**: Modify `backend_datas` and `frontend_datas` arrays in `build.py` for file inclusion

### Build System Workflow
1. **Development**: Edit source files normally
2. **Build Configuration**: Modify `build.py` for PyInstaller settings
3. **Build Process**: Run `python build.py` to generate fresh spec and build EXE
4. **Testing**: Test the generated EXE, not development environment

### Common Build Issues & Solutions
- **Missing modules in EXE**: Add to `hidden_imports` in `build.py`
- **Missing data files**: Add to appropriate `_datas` array in `build.py`
- **Database issues**: Ensure database migration system is properly imported
- **Frontend not loading**: Verify frontend build completed and dist files are included

### Build System Self-Check
Before modifying build configuration:
1. Is this change needed in the generated EXE?
2. Should this go in `hidden_imports`, `backend_datas`, or `frontend_datas`?
3. Have I tested the change by running the complete build process?
4. Does the EXE work correctly with fresh installations and existing data?
